# Uni Room Finder [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/declanjscott/uni-room-finder/_apis/build/status/declanjscott.uni-room-finder?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/declanjscott/uni-room-finder/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

[Uni Room Finder](https://uni-room-finder.firebaseapp.com) is a webapp which helps you find empty rooms at UNSW.

## Why?

There are lots of study spaces at UNSW, but it can be hard to find one that's free.

Uni Room Finder looks at the official campus timetable to find tutorial rooms and lecture theatres which don't have scheduled classes.

These rooms are great to study in! Find one and go have a look.

## Tech

- CI is set up through Azure Pipelines.
- Built with React and Firebase

## Current status

Basic functionality is complete, but it is very much still a work in progress. I am working on design and extra functionality to make it easier to use.

### Roadmap

- Transition animations
- Empty state for lists
- Tests
- Routing
